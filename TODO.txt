test zend/lang/30 : dynamic function call

==Type unsound (unknown type has same type as everything), maybe types should be abstract values ?

zend/basic/25 FunctionCall(var_dump, list(_POST, HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA), loc) ?

ObjectProperty ("a") not reduced : "a" is not a Value because not abstracted ?

foreach zend/lang/foreachLoop.001.phpt

	heap L->V:CompoundValue, but it's indirect in the tests with heap : L2->V thematrix : L->L2

	Assign 0 (or concrete string ?) because it's an array key (var_dump)

	maybe have a Key type ?
