- they agree that current is buggy, we provide a reasonable way to formalize

- this guy is in charge:
	http://nikic.github.io/
	his initial patch

=========
bug 60688
=========

- still open
- it's a "documentation bug" as well as probably a "proper bug" (in the sense that, as shown
  by both Wolfgang's example and our example, the comparison give weird results).

the doc says there is a function and that PHP use that internally to perform comparison:

compare($a,$b) = 
	| 0 if $a == $b, 
	| 1 if $a > $b 
	| -1 if $a < $b.

Reading this we might expect that (and in fact I implemented 

	$a < $b iff compare($a, $b) == -1
	$a > $b iff compare($a, $b) ==  1

but actually it seems that zend is doing

	$a < $b iff compare($a, $b) == -1
	$a > $b iff compare($b, $a) == -1

This btw, means that the "+1" branch is useless. We have now "implemented" the bug in kphp.

- for us depends on the interpretation of when arrays are copied.

  - we pass around as references, copy happens if you store them somewhere
  - bug reporter assumes they are passed around as literal
  - PHP behaves in the same way as KPHP, so the behaviour makes sense. 
    I think this is not a bug.
